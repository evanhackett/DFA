Inside the project folder there is a folder called DFA, inside this folder is where the input files are located
Currently there are 4 input files:
input.txt tests a machine that accepts even number of a's
input2.txt - even number of 0's
input3.txt - positive integers
input4.txt - any legal C variable name

The program will ask for a file name, enter one of these input files, or supply your own.
The program will then ask the user to enter a word. It will then check each letter of the word, and it will output whether or not the word is a valid word based on the input file.
The program will exit when the user enters "quit".
